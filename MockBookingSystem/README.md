# Mock Booking System API  

## Overview  
This project is a **Mock Booking System API** built using **ASP.NET Core Web API**. It simulates a booking system for the travel industry, allowing users to:  

- **Search** for holiday options (hotels and flights).  
- **Book** a selected option.  
- **Check** the status of their booking.  

---

## Features  

### 🔍 Search Endpoint (`/api/Search`)  
Allows users to search for:  
- **Hotels only**  
- **Hotels and flights**  
- **Last-minute hotels** (if the `FromDate` is within 45 days of the current date)  

Utilizes external APIs:  
- `SearchHotels API`  
- `SearchFlights API`  

Access API Endpoint host:

http://localhost:5000/{endpoint}

### 📌 Book Endpoint (`/api/Book`)  
- Allows users to book a selected option from the search results.  
- Generates a random **BookingCode** and stores booking details in memory.  

### 🔄 Check Status Endpoint (`/api/CheckStatus`)  
- Allows users to check the status of their booking.  
- **Booking status transitions:**  
  - **Pending** → After a random delay (30–60 seconds), it changes to:  
    - ✅ **Success** (for `HotelOnly` and `HotelAndFlight` searches).  
    - ❌ **Failed** (for `LastMinuteHotels` searches).  


## 🐳 Deployment Environment  
This application is deployed within a **Docker container**. The Docker setup ensures a **consistent and isolated environment** for running the application.

## How It Works

### Search Flow (`/api/Search`)

- The user sends a POST request with parameters like destination, departureAirport, fromDate, and toDate.
- The system determines the type of search:
  - HotelOnly: If departureAirport is not provided in the request body.
  - HotelAndFlight: If departureAirport is provided.
  - LastMinuteHotels: If fromDate is within 45 days of today and departureAirport is not provided in the request body.
- The appropriate manager (HotelOnlyManager, HotelAndFlightManager, or LastMinuteHotelsManager) handles the request.
- External APIs are called to fetch data:
  - Hotels: SearchHotels API
  - Flights: SearchFlights API
- Results are returned as an array of options.

### Book Flow (`/api/Book`)

- The user sends a POST request with an OptionCode (from the search results) and the original search request.
- A random BookingCode is generated, along with a random delay (SleepTime) between 30–60 seconds.
- Response result is the generated BookingCode which can be used in the checkstatus call.

### Check Status Flow (`/api/CheckStatus`)

- The user sends a POST request with their unique BookingCode.
- The system checks if enough time has passed since the booking:
  - If not, the status is Pending and result 2 is returned as a response.
  - If yes:
    - For HotelOnly and HotelAndFlight bookings: Status becomes Success.
    - For LastMinuteHotels bookings: Status becomes Failed.
